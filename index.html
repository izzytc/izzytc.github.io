    <div class="col-sm-4" >I am creating a mobile app for Te Papa to personalize a visitors experience.My mobile app will be an interactive feedback page where users are able to rate their personal experiences they had in Te papa. I will have a rating system with each exhibition. Te papa consists of 6 levels, so this will be reflected in how I layout my mobile app.</div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">You can use this app while you are in Te papa, as when you rate the different exhibitions the app will suggest other exhibition’s you would like depending on the rating. If you rate an exhibition very low then the app will ask you questions what you didn’t like etc, which you are able to skip and just see the other exhibitions which you would like. There will also be a high ranking exhibitions and this will allow users to see which exhibitions are the highest rating to the lowest, and can make a decision based on that.</div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">This app also helps Te Papa as it is providing constant feedback from different users. Te papa will be constantly aware of what the public likes and dislikes, and can make informed decisions when making changes to the museum. Allowing users to post as anonymous will be very useful in improving the museum. The app will also have an easy donating system based on the rating you gave on a exhibition, if a user was to rate very high a donating pop up will come up which they can either skip or donate.</div>

<h2 style="text-align:center" class="animated bounceInRight" >Interactions </h2>





<p> I will be implementing a simple star rating system where users are able to touch how many stars they are wanting and swipe left and right if they want to go to the particular suggested exhibiton. Once a user has clicked on an exhibiton they can say done and are able to rate it. My app will work on both mobile, ipad, and computer however the preffered method would be mobile and ipad due to the accesibility with these devices via walking around the Te Papa. However having it fit to all three devices allows Te Papa to take advantage of this and have this webpage accesible with computers around the museum, where people can use the app a bit differently, they can rate some exhbitions they have already been too and then can suggest for more places to look around. </p>

<h3 style="text-align:center" class="animated bounceInRight">How it benefits Te Papa </h3> 
<p> Te papa will have an online feedback form constantly in use, by the ratings and the option of users answering questions anonymously, allowing for more accurate feedback. They are able to see what is working and what isn't. This will hopefully increase visitor access as visitors are able to go around the museum actually looking at what they like rather than spending time on ones they don't. This is an easy user friendly way of getting good feedback.
